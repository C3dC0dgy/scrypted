# Vision Framework Object Detection for Scrypted

This plugin adds object detection capabilities to any camera in Scrypted. This plugin requires MacOS Vision Framework. Vision Framework utilizes the CPU, GPU, and Neural Cores (Apple Silicon).

The Vision Framework Plugin should only be used if you are a Scrypted NVR user. It will provide no
benefits to HomeKit, which does its own detection processing.
